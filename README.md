## Running the site locally

This website uses `gulp` and `hugo` to build the website. Please refer to the
documentation for each of those projects to install them.

- [Gulp Installation](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md)
- [Hugo Installation](https://gohugo.io/)

Once those two dependencies are installed, you run the following commands in the
terminal to build the site.

- `npm install`
- `gulp website`

The website is now available at `http://localhost:1313/`.
